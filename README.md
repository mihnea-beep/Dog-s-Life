# Dog-s-Life

As a dog knight, it is your sacred duty to find and consume every last bone you come across on your epic running spree.
Beware of red elixirs, as they can drastically reduce your speed or even make you run backwards. You don’t want to end up falling off the bridge or bumping into a bunch of spikes.

### Game mechanics

The map (the bridge the player is running on) is randomly generated, using different types of tiles, obstacles and power ups. The player’s speed gradually increases, making the game more and more difficult over time. 

Other than bones, the player can pick up elixirs. The elixirs’ effect consists of decreasing the player’s speed.
At the beginning of the game, they can make things slow and difficult. However, once the player gains more speed, they turn out to be pretty useful, helping them slow down and giving them more time to react to obstacles.

When dealing with obstacles, the player can jump or move left or right to avoid collision. When the player hits an obstacle, or falls off the bridge, the final score and the amount of collected bones are displayed in a Game Over menu.

However, this is an endless runner. The game is never over and the player is welcome to try again!
